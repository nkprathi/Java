we have an interface called Notification, and three concrete classes are implementing the Notification interface. A factory class NotificationFactory is created to get a Notification object. 

define an interface or abstract class for creating an object but let the subclasses decide which class to instantiate. In other words, subclasses are responsible to create the instance of the class.

Usage of Factory Design Pattern
* When a class doesn't know what sub-classes will be required to create
* When a class wants that its sub-classes specify the objects to be created.
* When the parent classes choose the creation of objects to its sub-classes.
